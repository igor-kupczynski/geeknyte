Geeknyte
========

Geeknyte is a command line [Egnyte](http://www.egnyte.com/) client for linux.

Project goals
-------------

- Provide a basic CLI client for unix based systems, especially for
  linux, where there is no official Egnyte client.
- Implement basic set of operations - list, put, get, delete, etc.
- Play with Egnyte's js sdk and with node js

Maturity
--------
This is a very early version. Its more a POC than a working
implementation.
